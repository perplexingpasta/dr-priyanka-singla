Use Proper Formats: Use modern image formats like WebP where possible, as they provide better compression and quality compared to older formats like JPEG and PNG.
Compress Images: Tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim can reduce image file sizes without significant loss in quality.
Use the srcset attribute for images to serve different image sizes based on the user's device screen size and resolution.
Use a CDN to distribute your static assets (like CSS and images) 
Use critical CSS
defer non critical css
